        <h3 class="header-tertiary">Why you should hire an agent who has partnered with a luxury real estate marketing
            company</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">One of the biggest perks of working with a real estate agent is their ability to
            market your property to the right target audience. A professional agent with the right experience will be
            able to identify who will be interested in your property and implement effective strategies to reach them
            via their website, paid advertising, social media, and other means. When you work with an agent who has
            partnered with Luxury Presence, you benefit from the many different types of marketing capabilities the
            company offers.
            Here is how:</p>

            <h3 class="header-tertiary">Paid Advertising on All Channels</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">To reach your potential buyers, you have to know who they are, where they spend
                their
                time online, and how they make their buying decisions. Agents who use luxury real estate marketing
                services
                are able to identify your niche market, then create paid ads on Facebook, Google, Instagram, and YouTube
                that reach those interested in your property. These paid ad campaigns are highly customized and
                targeted,
                ensuring you are not spending money marketing to those who are not in the market for a property such as
                yours.</p>

            <h3 class="header-tertiary">Expert Content Production</h3>
            <p class="paragraph dark">Content is one of the most powerful resources a real estate agent has to promote
                your
                property. Being able to create high-quality content such as video and copywriting is an essential tool
                that
                elevates the agents who use luxury real estate marketing services above their competitors. According to
                a
                recent survey, 85 percent of buyers and sellers want to work with an agent who uses video—and for good
                reason. An agent who uses video is able to connect with potential buyers on a deeper level and build
                trust
                and rapport. When they use video to market your property, they are showing viewers what it would really
                be
                like to walk through and live in your home—something that is much more difficult to do with a written
                description.
                However, written descriptions—or copywriting—is also important. Your property needs to be described in
                appealing and vibrant terms on the listing and on any additional marketing that is created to sell it.
                Those
                agents who work with Luxury Presence get access to experienced real estate copywriters who create blogs,
                website copy, and content marketing pieces that make your property attractive to potential buyers.

                to
                thousands of niche buyers who are ready to invest in property. To be an influencer, an agent either
                needs to
                dedicate a large chunk of their time to social media or they need to partner with luxury real estate
                marketing service providers who can put in the work for them. Wouldn’t you rather your agent spent his

                Presence,
                our dedicated success team utilizes an agent’s stories and feed posts to help them go viral and become
                an
                authority in their industry. Once they’ve harnessed the power of becoming an influencer, they can use
                their
                voice to advocate for your home and sell it more quickly than their competitors.</p>

            <p class="paragraph dark">Every real estate agent’s success starts with their website. If an agent doesn’t
                have
                a responsive, user-friendly website that is easy to navigate and provides an immersive experience for
                viewers who want to look at properties, they’ve already lost their advantage. Those agents who work with
                Luxury Presence have websites that are designed and managed by seasoned professionals who know what
                property
                buyers want. Their sites are designed to impress with virtual tour integration, HD video capabilities,
                and
                lead capture strategies that help agents sell your home. Agents are further supported by analytics
                reporting, SEO optimization, third party integrations, and a reporting dashboard to help them easily
                utilize
                their site and maximize its potential. An agent who is backed by a powerful website is one who can
                easily
                reach a niche audience, streamline the selling process, and ensure your home gets the best promotion
